Develop a Django REST-Api for Event Management

The primary goal of this task is to create a Django-based REST-Api that manages events (like conferences, meetups, etc.). The application will allow users to create, view, update, and delete events. It should also handle user registrations for these events.

  

Key Requirements

- Design an Event model with fields such as title, description, date, location, and organizer.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the Event model.
- Basic User Registration and Authentication.
- Event Registration
- API documentation
- Docker
- Readme file

  

Bonus Points

- Implement an advanced feature like event search or filtering.
- Add a feature for sending email notifications to users upon event registration.
